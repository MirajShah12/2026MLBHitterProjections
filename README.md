# 2026 MLB Hitter Projections

This repository contains Miraj Shah's 2026 predicted wRC+ leaders for Major League Baseball. The projections focus on identifying offensive value and calculating a specific discrepancy metric to find undervalued players.

## Project Details

The analysis centers on two primary data points:
* **Projected wRC+**: The expected offensive output for the 2026 season.
* **Discrepancy Metric**: The difference between a hitter's actual 2025 wRC+ and their projected 2026 wRC+.

## Accessing the Data

The full projections, including all hitter rankings and calculated metrics, are located in the `2025_predictions.csv` file.

## Customization

This project is intended to be iterative. You can adjust the model parameters or the metrics used in the discrepancy calculation as needed to refine the results or test different performance hypotheses.
